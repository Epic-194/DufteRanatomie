Title: 'Red Pulp'

Clinical: 'During early fetal development, the spleen is temporarily an organ of <b>hematopoiesis</b>. This role is taken over by the liver and then bone marrow. However, in severe cases of <b>anemia</b> or <b>myeloproliferative disorders</b> in children and adults, the spleen may produce new blood cells, a condition referred to as <b>extramedullary hematopoiesis</b> (occurs outside of the bone marrow).'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b> Red pulp constitutes most of the spleen, its color being due mostly to abundant erythrocytes. Found around white pulp,  it consists of many thin-walled venous sinusoids and intervening cellular, or splenic, cords (of Billroth). The term splenic cords is misleading, in that these are labyrinthine spaces between sinusoids containing a scaffold of reticular fibers. Many closely packed fixed or wandering cells—reticular cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and all formed elements of circulating blood—occupy these spaces. Venous sinusoids are a tortuous network of thin-walled vessels with irregular lumina. With diameters of 30 to 50 μm, they have a unique structure related to high permeability. They are made of spindle-shaped, longitudinally oriented endothelial cells.'

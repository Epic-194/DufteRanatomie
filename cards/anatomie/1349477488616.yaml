Title: 'Perineum and Deep Perineum 1'

Clinical: '<b>Clinical:</b> During childbirth, the urogenital sphincter complex can be stretched, weakening their actions both as sphincters and support structures of the lower perineum.<br>Urinary track infections (UTI) are more common in women, in part because of their shorter urethra and the proximity to pathogens that may be present in the vestibule (region defined by the labia minora).<br>'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b>  The anatomy of these muscles is controversial.  The urethral sphincter might be more of a urogenital sphincter, consisting of a compressor urethrae muscle and a sphincter urethrovaginalis muscle.  The sphincter action of these muscles is debatable.  <br><br>These muscles are innervated primarily by the perineal branch of the pudendal nerve (S2-4).  <br><br>On one side of this illustration, the ishiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles have been removed to show the underlying erectile tissues of the bulb of the vestibule and the crus of the clitoris (still ensheathed in a fascial layer).  Posterior to the bulb of the vestibule lies the greater vestibular (Bartholinampersandapos;s) gland, which secretes mucus during sexual arousal that lubricates the vaginal opening.<br>'

Many such pharmaceuticals inhibit the proliferation of infectious bacteria by targeting the ribosome. They bind to specific regions of the large or small subunit, interfering with translation and protein synthesis in the pathogen. Antibiotic resistance has become a serious public health problem around the world.'

They are uniform in size, about 15 to 20 nm in diameter, and consist mostly of RNA and associated proteins. Free ribosomes in the cytoplasm occur as single particles or rosette- like clusters, known as polyribosomes, which consist of several ribosomes arranged along a thread of messenger RNA (mRNA). Single ribosomes are inactive, whereas polyribosomes are active in protein synthesis, where they assemble specific amino acids into polypeptides. Ribosomes may be attached to membranes of the rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (RER) or to the outer nuclear membrane. Polyribosomes synthesize proteins for internal use by the cell, whereas ribosomes attached to the RER engage in protein synthesis for export from the cell or for proteins destined for lysosomes.'

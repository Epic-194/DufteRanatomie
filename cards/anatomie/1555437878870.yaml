Clinical: 'There are many forms of <b>uveitis</b>—an inflammation of the uvea—that may lead to <b>red eye</b>, pain, and decreased vision. <b>Anterior uveitis</b> (or <b>iritis</b>), the most common form, usually occurs in healthy people. It may also be associated with <b>autoimmune diseases</b> and may be due to <b>viral</b> and <b>bacterial infection</b>, or <b>parasitic infestation</b>, such as <b>toxoplasmosis</b>.'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b> The iris is the most anterior part of the uvea and separates anterior and posterior chambers. It is a circular diaphragm, 10 mm to 12 mm in diameter. It regulates the amount of light reaching the retina by adjusting the size of its central aperture—the pupil. A double layer of pigmented cuboidal epithelium covers the posterior surface, whereas a discontinuous layer of stromal cells—a mixture of fibroblasts and pigment-containing melanocytes—is on the anterior surface. In the stroma near the pupillary margin is the constrictor pupillae muscle consisting of a flat ring of circumferential smooth muscle. Myoepithelial cells of the inner layer of the posterior epithelium constitute the dilator pupillae.'

Clinical: '<b>Tonsillitis</b>, or inflammation of the tonsil, is especially common in children, and it often accompanies pharyngitis. It results from either a <b>bacterial infection</b>, such as that caused by <b>Streptococcus</b>, or a <b>viral infection</b>, such as that caused by the <b>Epstein Barr virus</b>.'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b> Tonsils are discrete aggregates of lymphoid nodules under the epithelium-lining entrances to the digestive and respiratory tracts. They can be seen with the naked eye as 3 separate masses. In the wall of the oropharynx lies a bilateral pair of palatine tonsils.  At the base of the tongue sit 2 lingual tonsils, and 1 pharyngeal tonsil is in the posterior part of the nasopharynx. These tonsils together form a prominent ring of strategically located lymphoid tissue called Waldeyerâ€™s ring. The tonsils are partly encapsulated structures that lack afferent lymphatic vessels but are drained by efferent lymphatic channels.'

A common cause is portal hypertension resulting from cirrhosis of the liver. The spleen of affected patients is  modestly enlarged, weighing 300 g to 800 g, and the capsule becomes thick and fibrotic.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-6a42c7b30a9a58fd62e531ed44c7440b4df8972e.jpg"><br>Comment: The spleen lies in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen, behind the stomach and just below the diaphragm. In adults, this largest lymphoid organ is the size of a clenched fist and weighs 180 g to 250 g. At the hilum on the medial surface, the splenic artery and nerves enter and the splenic vein and lymphatics leave. The spleen is a major repository for mononuclear phagocytic cells, accounts for 25% of the total number of lymphocytes, and stores about a third of the bodyâ€™s platelets. The organ filters blood by clearing particulate matter, infectious organisms, and aged or defective erythrocytes and platelets. It recycles iron from worn-out erythrocytes. Primarily macrophages perform these functions. The spleen is also a secondary lymphoid organ: lymphocytes respond to blood-borne antigens by initiating an immune reaction that activates T and B cells.'

Clinical: '<b>Lymphomas</b> are localized lymphocyte malignancies that often form solid tumors, mainly affecting lymph nodes. <b>Hodgkin disease</b> is  a major type of lymphoma distinguished by the presence of <i>Reed-Sternberg cells</i> in lymph nodes.'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b> Lymph nodes contain aggregates of lymphocytes organized into an outer cortex, a paracortex, and an inner medulla. The darkly stained cortex just under the capsule consists of lymphoid nodules. B cells occupy lymphoid nodules in the cortex, and T cells are in the paracortex, or thymus-dependent region. An outer capsule of dense fibrous connective tissue that typically merges with surrounding tissues and fat invests each node. It sends delicate, radiating collagen-containing partitions called trabeculae into the interior of the nodes. Afferent lymphatic vessels merge with the capsule and empty into the subcapsular space; the lymph percolates through the sinuses to the medulla, where it is collected by the efferent vessel.'

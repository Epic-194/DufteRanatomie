Title: 'Gallbladder and Extrahepatic Bile Ducts'

Clinical: '<b>Clinical:</b> Gallstones occur in about 10% to 20% of adults; risk factors include increased age, obesity, and being female. About 80% of gallstones are cholesterol stones, and about 20% are pigment (bilirubin calcium salts) stones. Gallstones can block the flow of bile from the gallbladder to the duodenum and cause inflammation (cholecystitis) or block the hepatopancreatic ampulla and impede exocrine secretion from the pancreas. The pain of acute cholecystitis maybe felt in the right upper abdominal quadrant, radiating laterally just beneath the right breast to the back just below the inferior angle of the right scapula.'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b>  Bile leaves the liver by the right and left hepatic ducts, draining into a common hepatic duct.  The latter drains via the cystic duct into the gallbladder, which concentrates and stores bile.  When stimulated by autonomic nerves and cholecystokinin, the gallbladder contracts, sending bile down the cystic duct.  The bile flows through the common bile duct to the major duodenal papilla, which empties into the descending duodenum.  At this location, the common bile duct joins the main pancreatic duct to form the hepatopancreatic ampulla of Vater. Gallstones occur in about 10 percent to 20 percent of adults; risk factors include increased age, obesity, and being female.  About 80 percent of gallstones are cholesterol stones, and about 20 percent are pigment (bilirubin calcium salts) stones.  Gallstones can block the flow of bile from the gallbladder to the duodenum and cause inflammation (cholecystitis) or block the hepatopancreatic ampulla and impede exocrine secretion from the pancreas.'

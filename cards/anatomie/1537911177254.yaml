Clinical: '<div>The joint between the mandible and the temporal bone&nbsp;(temporomandibular joint [TMJ]) is located at the&nbsp;mandibular fossa. This joint is a bicondylar joint, actually&nbsp;involving the joints of both sides. Within each TMJ, an&nbsp;articular disk separates the joint into upper and lower joint&nbsp;cavities. The upper joint cavity is a sliding joint, allowing&nbsp;protrusion and retrusion of the mandible. The lower joint&nbsp;cavity primarily acts as a hinge joint, but some rotation&nbsp;is permitted. This is associated with the grinding motion&nbsp;of the teeth during chewing. Another example of a&nbsp;bicondylar joint is the knee, although in this case, the two&nbsp;condyles are contained within each joint cavity.</div>'

Clinical: '<b>Urethritis</b>—an inflammation of the urethra—affects men and women equally. It may be caused by <b>bacterial</b> or <b>viral infection</b>, and is often associated with <b>sexually transmitted disease (STD)</b>. <b>Gonococcal urethritis</b> usually has a shorter incubation period than the <b>nongonococcal</b> form of the disease.'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b> The female urethra is about 4 cm long and 8 mm wide. It has 3 concentric layers: mucosa, muscularis externa, and adventitia. Its crescent-shaped lumen is lined by transitional epithelium that gradually changes to stratified columnar, and then stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium at its opening into the vestibule. Invaginations of epithelium form mucus-secreting urethral glands, and the lamina propria has an extensive venous plexus. The male urethra, 15 to 20 cm long, is divided into 3 segments: prostatic, membranous, and spongy. Like that in the female urethra, the epithelium of the male urethra shows similar regional changes.'

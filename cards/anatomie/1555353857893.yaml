Clinical: '<b>Familial hypercholesterolemia</b> is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation in the gene on chromosome 19 that encodes the LDL receptors. The defective receptors lose their affinity for coated pits, and cellular uptake of cholesterol is blocked. This causes a severe elevation in serum cholesterol, which may lead to premature atherosclerotic lesions in the walls of blood vessels, such as the coronary arteries.'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b> Cells have several kinds of membrane-bound vesicles that form by invaginations of plasma membrane. They then enter the cytoplasm by pinching off from the surface and are transported to other parts of the cell. Many caveolae in endothelial cells mediate transcytosis, whereby vesicles derived from caveolae are taken across a cell and release their contents at another surface. Other kinds of cytoplasmic vesicles, most derived from the Golgi complex, engage in exocytosis. Vesicles move to the cell surface, fuse with plasma membrane, and discharge contents to the cell exterior.'
